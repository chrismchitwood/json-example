    "text": "Abstract:  Mouse Balls Available as FRU (Field Replacement Unit)\nMouse balls are now available as FRU.  Therefore, if a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel. \n\nSource: http://textfiles.com/100/balls.txt"

    "text": "So you think you are a geek, eh?  The first step is to admit to yourself your geekiness.  No matter what anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks have rights.  So take a deep breath and announce to the world that you are a geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever. How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask?  Use the universal Geek code.  By joining the geek organization, you have license to use this special code that will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a simple, codified statement./nThe single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to signature file and announce it far and wide.  But be careful, you may give other geeks the courage to come out of the closet.  You might want to hang on to your copy of the code in order to help them along. \n\nSource: http://textfiles.com/100/codegeek.txt "
